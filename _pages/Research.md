Research Interest <i class="fa fa-rocket" aria-hidden="true"></i>
======
<p style="text-align:justify;">My primary field of research interest is <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b>. Within AI, I am interested in problems related to <b>Probabilistic Modeling, Applied Machine Learning, Health Data Mining</b>, and interdisciplinary applications of <b>Computer Vision</b> in Robotics. My research revolves around elegant modeling of problems of practical interest, understanding the fundamental principles of statistical machine learning, designing scalable algorithms with guarantees, and analyzing their computational and information-theoretic properties rigorously. Moreover, with the help of modeling and scheme of AI, I have also a substantial overview in the field of Robotics, more precisely â€“ <b>Design Analysis, Path Finding, Robot Vision, Object Tracking</b> and application of <b>Probabilistic Models</b> to the Segmentation problem.</p>

Research Facility <i class="fa fa-object-ungroup" aria-hidden="true"></i>
======
<p style="text-align:justify;"> I have a small research facilty named <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/31245254" target="_blank"><b>TF-ROS</b></a> (TF = <i>TensorFlow</i>, ROS = <i>Robot Operating System</i>) Lab to accomodate my projects. The lab's research focuses on the areas of Mobile and Aerial Robotics, Robotic Vision, Mechanism Design and Multi Robotic Systems. Most of my projects are run from here. 6 undergraduate students of North South University are working with me. The lab received a fund of BDT <b>500K</b> in the fiscal year of 2018-2019. </p>
