Research Interest <i class="fa fa-rocket" aria-hidden="true"></i>
======
My primary field of research interest is **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. Within AI, I am interested in problems related to **Probabilistic Modeling, Applied Machine Learning, Health Data Mining**, and interdisciplinary applications of **Computer Vision** in Robotics. My research revolves around elegant modeling of problems of practical interest, understanding the fundamental principles of statistical machine learning, designing scalable algorithms with guarantees, and analyzing their computational and information-theoretic properties rigorously. Moreover, with the help of modeling and scheme of AI, I have also a substantial overview in the field of Robotics, more precisely â€“ **Design Analysis, Path Finding, Robot Vision, Object Tracking** and application of **Probabilistic Models** to the Segmentation problem.
