Research Interest <i class="fa fa-rocket" aria-hidden="true"></i>
======
<p style="text-align:justify;">My primary field of research interest is <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b>. Within AI, I am interested in problems related to <b>Probabilistic Modeling, Applied Machine Learning, Health Data Mining</b>, and interdisciplinary applications of <b>Computer Vision</b> in Robotics. My research revolves around understanding the fundamental principles of statistical machine learning, designing scalable algorithms with guarantees, and rigorously analyzing their computational and information-theoretic properties. Moreover, with the help of modeling and scheme of AI, I have also a substantial overview in the field of Robotics, more precisely â€“ <b>Design Analysis, Path Finding, Robot Vision, Object Tracking</b> and application of <b>Probabilistic Models</b> to the Segmentation problem.</p>

Research Facility <i class="fa fa-object-ungroup" aria-hidden="true"></i>
======
<p style="text-align:justify;"> I have a small research facility named <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/31245254" target="_blank"><b>TF-ROS</b></a> (TF = <b><i>TensorFlow</i></b>, ROS = <b><i>Robot Operating System</i></b>) Lab to accommodate my projects. The lab's research focuses on the areas of <b>Mobile and Aerial Robotics, Robotic Vision, Mechanism Design</b> and <b>Multi Robotic Systems</b>. Most of my projects are running from here. Six undergraduate students of North South University are working with me. The lab received a fund of BDT <b>500K</b> in the fiscal year of 2018-2019. </p>
