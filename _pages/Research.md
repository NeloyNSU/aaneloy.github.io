Research Interest <i class="fa fa-rocket" aria-hidden="true"></i>
======
<p style="text-align:justify;">My primary field of research interest is <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b>. Within AI, I am interested in problems related to <b>Probabilistic Modeling, Applied Machine Learning, Health Data Mining</b>, and interdisciplinary applications of <b>Computer Vision</b> in Robotics. My research revolves around elegant modeling of problems of practical interest, understanding the fundamental principles of statistical machine learning, designing scalable algorithms with guarantees, and analyzing their computational and information-theoretic properties rigorously. Moreover, with the help of modeling and scheme of AI, I have also a substantial overview in the field of Robotics, more precisely â€“ <b>Design Analysis, Path Finding, Robot Vision, Object Tracking</b> and application of <b>Probabilistic Models</b> to the Segmentation problem.</p>
